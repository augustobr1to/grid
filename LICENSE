License Compatibility Notice
════════════════════════════

Grid Engine is licensed under the MIT License (see top of this file).

All runtime dependencies ship under the MIT License, which is fully compatible
with MIT. MIT-licensed code may be freely combined, distributed, and
sublicensed under MIT.

TypeScript is used exclusively as a build-time development tool and is never
compiled into or bundled with the distributed output of this project. Its
Apache License 2.0 therefore does not affect the license terms of Grid Engine
or any build artifact produced from it. Consumers of Grid Engine do not need
to include the Apache 2.0 notice for TypeScript in their own distributions
unless they independently incorporate the TypeScript compiler into their
toolchain.
